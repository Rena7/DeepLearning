Using predict() would give binary outputs: 0 or 1, losing important gradient information. The gradient is important for learning, as the weight update is based on the derivative of the sigmoid function, output * (1 - output), which wouldn't be achievable with binary outputs. In brief, the sigmoid's continuous output allows the model to better adjust weights depending on how incorrect the prediction was, facilitating smoother and more efficient learning."

For instance, with 100 training examples, 20 iterations, and a learning rate of 0.05, the model was 70.0% accurate. However, with 200 examples and a reduced learning rate of 0.005, the accuracy dropped to 68.0%. This means training on a reduced representative subset of data with well-chosen hyperparameters can work better than training on the full dataset."

For the second run, the learning rate of 0.005 is probably too low, leading to slow and inefficient weight adjustments. Despite additional training data, the model is unable to converge to an optimal solution within 20 epochs. This points to the need to balance the amount of data with suitable learning rates and epoch numbers."

We can also try increasing the number of epochs, tweaking the learning rate, or trying more complex strategies such as adaptive learning rates or regularization to make the model generalize more. More advanced hyperparameter optimization methods or grid searche method may be able to improve accuracy beyond the current 70.0% accuracy."

    "D. It is not the case that more epochs will always improve model performance. A learning rate that is too low can lead to a slow model convergence, and too many epochs will also lead to overfitting the training set and hence reduced test accuracy. Effective early stopping procedures and cross-validation can find the ideal number of epochs to use for optimal generalization.Plotting these results on accuracy vs. training set size, epochs, and learning rate plots would make these trends more understandable and finding optimal parameter settings easier."
